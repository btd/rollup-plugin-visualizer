# Rollup Plugin Visualizer

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/rollup-plugin-visualizer.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/rollup-plugin-visualizer) [![Node.js CI](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/btd/rollup-plugin-visualizer/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

Visualize and analyze your Rollup bundle to see which modules are taking up space.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
```

or via yarn:

```sh
yarn add --dev rollup-plugin-visualizer
```

## V5 Upgrade

Version V5 contains seveal minor breaking changes, depending your current installation take such steps before upgrade:

- If you are using rollup v1.x, then you'd better to stay on v4 of plugin. I officially stopped support v1 of rolloup myself. Some versions of 1.x will work without issues, but i stop testing myself or add any changes in this direction. If somebody wants to contibute in this direction - welcome.
- If you use rollup v2.x and use `gzipLength` or `brotliLength`upgrade to rollup 2.44 at least. In V5 i use provided by rollup api to get rendered module code for size estimations, instead of original sources as it was before.
- In all other case just update the plugin.

To upgrade plugin change import/require statement like it is shown in installation/usage sections.

## Usage

Import

```javascript
// es
import { visualizer } from "rollup-plugin-visualizer";
// or
// cjs
const { visualizer } = require("rollup-plugin-visualizer");
```

Usage with rollup (rollup.config.js)

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // put it the last one
    visualizer(),
  ],
};
```

Usage with vite (vite.config.js)

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [visualizer()],
};
```

Usage with SvelteKit (svelte.config.js)

```js
import path from "path";

const config = {
  kit: {
    vite: {
			plugins: [
				visualizer({
					emitFile: true,
					file: 'stats.html'
				})
			]
		}
  },
};

export default config;
```

You will find 2/3 files in .svelte-kit/output dir named stats.html (see vite logs for file locations) . You can use this snippet as a starting point and change props/path.
You can also generate 3 json files and combine them to one with cli util.

## How to use generated files

Blue color used to to mark project-own files. This could be: written by you files or generated by build tool files.

Green color used to mark your dependencies.

Internally it just checks if file id prefix is `node_modules`.

All charts refresh layout on window resize.

### Sunburst

This circular hierarchical diagram can help you find huge peaces of code (aka that one huge thing). If you click on some arc it will increase its and all nested arcs size for better inspection.

### Treemap

This rectangular hierarchical diagram can help you find huge peaces. Just look on biggest reclangle. But also it can help you find modules included several times, they will have the same topology and relative size. If you click on reclangle it will increase in size for further inspection.

### Network

This digram should help you answer for the question 'why it is included?'. After force layout stabilize all nodes, you can move it back and forth by dragging with your mouse. Gray circles are treeshakened out files.

In real life scenarious, sometimes you will see terribly connected diagrams. There is no 100% working solution for everyone, it is expected you topology will look 'terrible' and not hold on screen. To make it still visually ispectable, first remove all highly connected nodes that you see (typical examples: commonjsHelpers, tslib, react etc, basically if tooltip for the node is not hold on the screen - exclude this node), after layout stabilization you will see, your layout is not that terrible anymore and most of dependencies cluster together. Move layout to find peaces you looked for.

## Options

`filename` (string, default `stats.html`) - name of the file with diagram to generate

`title` (string, default `Rollup Visualizer`) - title tag value

`sourcemap` (boolean, default `false`) - Use sourcemaps to calculate sizes (e.g. after UglifyJs or Terser). **Always add plugin as last option.**

`open` (boolean, default `false`) - Open generated file in default user agent

`template` (string, default `treemap`) - Which diagram type to use: `sunburst`, `treemap`, `network`.

`json` (boolean, default `false`) - Produce portable json file that can be used with plugin CLI util to generate graph from several json files. Every UI property ignored in this case.

`gzipSize` (boolean, default `false`) - Collect gzip size from source code and display it at chart.

`brotliSize` (boolean, default `false`) - Collect brotli size from source code and display it at chart.

`projectRoot` (string | RegExp, default `process.cwd()`) - This is some common root(s) path to your files. This is used to cut absolute files paths out.

## CLI

This plugin provides cli util `rollup-plugin-visualizer`. Add `--help` to check actual options. It can be used like:

```sh
rollup-plugin-visualizer [OPTIONS] stat1.json stat2.json ../stat3.json
```

This can be usefull in case you have different config files in the same project and you want to display all of them in the same chart.

## Build plugin

For development if you need to build plugin, just exec:

```js
npm run build
```

## Disclaimer about generated files

Generated html files do not and never will contain your source code (contents of files). They can contain only js/html/css code required to build chart (plugin code) and statistical information about your source code.

This statistical information can contain:

- size of files included in bundle
- size of files included in source map
- file's paths
- files hierarchy (fs tree for your files)

## Upgrades

See CHANGELOG.md.
